# RepositoryService

For an introduction to code conversion patterns, see the [patterns README](../README.md).

This document discusses code conversion patterns from the Camunda 7 engine's RepositoryService to the Camunda Spring SDK.

The different commands of the RepositoryService are grouped by action, such as deploying a process definition, with multiple examples covering different methods of performing the same action.
